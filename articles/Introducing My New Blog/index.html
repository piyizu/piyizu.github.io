<h2 id="on-the-blog-and-me">On the Blog and Me</h2>
<p>I've been writing things on blogs since 8 years ago, when I was just a junior high school student. This blog is just a new one running on Github Pages. My old blog, which I haven't updated for years, can be found <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/mrblug" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I used Mr.Blug as the nickname. Now I put my true name on the new blog so that you can identify me in a second.</p>
<h2 id="on-tools-to-build-the-blog">On Tools to Build the Blog</h2>
<p>Pelican helps me a lot in building the blog. The theme templates it provides are nice and easy-to-use. With Pelican and the themes from the community, I could complete the whole website within one day.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not very good at webpage design. All I can do on HTML's and CSS's is to edit a given one, reading online tutorials at the same time! I knew there are many other wonderful tools like Pelican, but I chose it because it's small, simple but flexible. Once Pelican is installed by a simple instruction of "pip", almost everything is prepared and I can start to write my articles and decorate my website at any time. The reference manual is excellent and detailed. Everything about Pelican can be found there!</p>
<h2 id="on-whom-the-blog-is-for">On Whom the Blog Is For</h2>
<p>The blog is for people who love coding and who are interested in computer science and software engineering. That's a JOKE! I welcome everyone to visit my blog :-) If you don't like reading things about computers, just click here and click there --- who knows what surprise you will find.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-a-file-from-my-blog">How to Download a File from my Blog?</h2>
<p>There are roughly two kinds of files available to download in the blog: files that are small with internal links and files that are big with external links.</p>
<p>Click <a href="/articles/Introducing My New Blog/download.txt" target="_blank">here</a> to download an example internal file. It's a small text file, and some browsers may directly open it for you.</p>
<p>Click <a href="https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/" target="_blank">here</a> to open an external link. It's EICAR virus test files download page! You can download those files to test your antimalware! Haven't heard of computer virus for a long time? <strong>Be careful when downloading a file from the Internet</strong>, as the virus is less conspicuous and is not yet extinct.</p>
<h2 id="will-math-formulae-be-correctly-displayed">Will Math Formulae Be Correctly Displayed?</h2>
<p>Don't worry about this problem. If the javascripts are loaded and enabled, nothing will go wrong <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<h2 id="on-the-time-format">On the Time Format</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that I use a rather formal time format across the blog. This format comes from the standard <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a>. One basic form of standard time format is '[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss][+-][hh][mm]'.</p>
<p>[YYYY] represents a 4-digit year, such as 2024.</p>
<p>[MM] is a 2-digit month, such as 03 and 12.</p>
<p>[DD] is a 2-digit day, such as 05 and 31.</p>
<p>[hh] is a 2-digit hour number ranging from 0 to 23.</p>
<p>[mm] represents a 2-digit minute and [ss] refers to a 2-digit second. </p>
<p>Letter 'T' is a separator between date and time, indicating the start of a time.</p>
<p>[+-] can be either '+' or '-', indicating the difference of the local time from UTC. For example, I am now in China, and my local time is 8 hours ahead of UTC (If it's 01:00 in UTC at present, it should be 09:00 in my local timezone now). Therefore, '[+-][hh][mm]' is '+0800'.</p>
<p>If the local timezone is exactly UTC, '[+-][hh][mm]' will simply be a letter 'Z'.</p>
<p>The release (publish) time of the articles uses the format '[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm][+-][hh][mm]'. That's the basic format without the field of second. However, if you check the bottom of each web page, you will see a page generation time stamp, where the full basic format is used.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-language">On the Language</h2>
<p>English is not my native language. I use English because it's supported on almost all devices and the number of people who can read English is certainly larger than that of who can read Chinese, which is my first language. Therefore, people all over the world can read my articles without any help from online translators. Articles in my blog would mainly related to computer science, where English nouns are common, but I don't like adding too many English words in my Chinese articles. The mixture is disgusting to me. That's another reason I build this English blog.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-tips">On the Tips</h2>
<p>We don't talk about money here. So these are real "tips".</p>
<p>When you scroll the page down, do you see the "Back To Top" tab appear on the righthand side of the top menu bar? Click it and it'll take you back to the top of the page, where the table of contents is.</p>
<p><img class="width-200px" src="/articles/Introducing My New Blog/introducing_backtotop.png"/></p>
<p class="caption-of-img-or-table">The "Back To Top" Tab</p>
<p>Do you think the font size of the articles is too small or too big? If you are using a desktop, press Ctrl key and at the same time roll your mouse wheel down or up to zoom the whole page in or out. Our website is currently not suitable for small-screen devices like mobile phones. Large tables and complex formulae need larger screens. Nevertheless, if you have to visit the website on a mobile phone, you can try the landscape mode.</p>
<p>Links that take you to external websites will be opened as a new page. Links whose targets are pages in this website usually open in the current page.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-priciples-of-my-blog">On the Priciples of My Blog</h2>
<p>In my opinion, my blog should be clean and simple. There shouldn't be too much meaningless information on the website. So there will be <strong>NO AD</strong>, <strong>NO ANIMATION</strong> and <strong>NO NONSENSE</strong>. I also think that the speed of my blog is important. My blog is currently running on Github Pages, so fancy stuff can't be added to the wesite. Waiting more than 10 seconds for a thousand-word passage is intolerable.</p>
<p>It's very important to me that my blog will be accessible anytime as long as Github Pages service is online. I make all javascripts and style files be local files on the website server. No external connection is required to load the web pages, so the website is independent and stable. That some parts of the website interface fail to load due to errors on some CDN server should not be possible. Furthermore, the loading speed of the website depends almost completely on the network condition between you and Github Pages servers. There should be no concern to visitors in Chinese Mainland that the Great Firewall would block something like scripts on Google's servers and one has to wait for minutes to get a loaded web page.</p>
<p>The top menu bar is designed to look like a piece of frosted glass. It's like the taskbar in Windows 7 or Windows Vista, where Windows Aero effcts are turned on. Windows Aero is a brilliant degisn of user interface. It's clear, bright and vivid. Light colours bring positive moods to people. In this wicked world, nothing can be more valuable than hope and things that bring hope to people.</p>
<p>Some people may share their life in the blogs, while I do not. Nevertheless, I would share what I thought or I'm thinking with you, some of which would be regarded by somebody to be political. I hereby declare that I have NO INTENTION TO OFFEND any governments or societies and I have NO INTEREST in politics. Do not dream all day!</p>
