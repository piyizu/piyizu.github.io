<h2 id="on-the-blog-and-me">On the Blog and Me</h2>
<p>    I've been writing things on blogs since 8 years ago, when I was just a junior high school student. This blog is just a new one running on Github Pages. My old blog, which I haven't updated for years, can be found <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/mrblug" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
    I used Mr.Blug as the nickname. Now I put my true name on the new blog so that you can identify me in a second.</p>
<h2 id="on-tools-to-build-the-blog">On Tools to Build the Blog</h2>
<p>    Pelican helps me a lot in building the blog. The theme templates it provides are nice and easy-to-use. With Pelican and the themes from the community, I could complete the whole website within one day.<br/>
    To be honest, I am not very good at webpage design. All I can do on HTML's and CSS's is to edit a given one, reading online tutorials at the same time! I knew there are many other wonderful tools like Pelican, but I chose it because it's small, simple but flexible. Once Pelican is installed by a simple instruction of "pip", almost everything is prepared and I can start to write my articles and decorate my website at any time. The reference manual is excellent and detailed. Everything about Pelican can be found there!</p>
<h2 id="on-whom-the-blog-is-for">On Whom the Blog Is For</h2>
<p>    The blog is for people who love coding and who are interested in computer science and software engineering. That's a JOKE! I welcome everyone to visit my blog :-) If you don't like reading things about computers, just click here and click there --- who knows what surprise you will find.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-a-file-from-my-blog">How to Download a File from my Blog?</h2>
<p>    There are roughly two kinds of files available to download in the blog: files that are small with internal links and files that are big with external links.<br/>
    Click <a href="/articles/Introducing My New Blog/download.txt" target="_blank">here</a> to download an example internal file. It's a small text file, and some browsers may directly open it for you.<br/>
    Click <a href="https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/" target="_blank">here</a> to open an external link. It's EICAR virus test files download page! You can download those files to test your antimalware! Haven't heard of computer virus for a long time? <strong>Be careful when downloading a file from the Internet</strong>, as the virus is less conspicuous and is not yet extinct.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-time-format">On the Time Format</h2>
<p>    You may have noticed that I use a rather formal time format across the blog. This format comes from the standard <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a>. One basic form of standard time format is '[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss][+-][hh][mm]'.<br/>
    [YYYY] represents a 4-digit year, such as 2024.<br/>
    [MM] is a 2-digit month, such as 03 and 12.<br/>
    [DD] is a 2-digit day, such as 05 and 31.<br/>
    [hh] is a 2-digit hour number ranging from 0 to 23.<br/>
    [mm] represents a 2-digit minute and [ss] refers to a 2-digit second.<br/>
    Letter 'T' is a separator between date and time, indicating the start of a time.<br/>
    [+-] can be either '+' or '-', indicating the difference of the local time from UTC. For example, I am now in China, and my local time is 8 hours plus UTC(If it's 01:00 in UTC at present, it should be 09:00 in my local timezone now). Therefore, '[+-][hh][mm]' is '+0800'.<br/>
    If the local timezone is exactly UTC, '[+-][hh][mm]' will simply be a letter 'Z'.<br/>
    The release (publish) time of the articles uses the format '[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm][+-][hh][mm]'. That's the basic format without the field of second. However, if you check the bottom of each web page, you will see a page generation time stamp, where the full basic format is used.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-language">On the Language</h2>
<p>    English is not my native language. I use English because it's supported on almost all devices and the number of people who can read English is certainly larger than that of who can read Chinese, which is my first language. Therefore, people all over the world can read my articles without any help from online translators. Articles in my blog would mainly related to computer science, where English nouns are common, but I don't like adding too many English words in my Chinese articles. The mixture is disgusting to me. That's another reason I build this English blog. I would use simple English in my blog.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-priciples-of-my-blog">On the Priciples of My Blog</h2>
<p>    In my opinion, my blog should be clean and simple. There shouldn't be too much meaningless information on the website. So there will be <strong>NO AD</strong>, <strong>NO ANIMATION</strong> and <strong>NO NONSENSE</strong>. I also think that the speed of my blog is important. My blog is currently running on Github Pages, so fancy stuff can't be added to the wesite. Waiting more than 10 seconds for a thousand-word passage is intolerable.<br/>
    Some people may share their life in the blogs, while I do not. Nevertheless, I would share what I thought or I'm thinking with you, some of which would be regarded by somebody to be political. I hereby declare that I have NO INTENTION TO OFFEND any governments or societies and I have NO INTEREST in politics. Do not dream all day!</p>
