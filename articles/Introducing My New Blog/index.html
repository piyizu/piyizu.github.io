<h2 id="on-the-blog-and-me">On the Blog and Me</h2>
<p>    I've been writing things on blogs since 8 years ago, when I was just a junior high school student. This blog is just a new one running on Github Pages. My old blog, which I haven't updated for years, can be found <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/mrblug" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
    I used Mr.Blug as the nickname. Now I put my true name on the new blog so that you can identify me in a second.</p>
<h2 id="on-tools-to-build-the-blog">On Tools to Build the Blog</h2>
<p>    Pelican helps me a lot in building the blog. The theme templates it provides are nice and easy-to-use. With Pelican and the themes from the community, I could complete the whole website within one day.<br/>
    To be honest, I am not very good at webpage design. All I can do on HTML's and CSS's is to edit a given one, reading online tutorials at the same time! I knew there are many other wonderful tools like Pelican, but I chose it because it's small, simple but flexible. Once Pelican is installed by a simple instruction of "pip", almost everything is prepared and I can start to write my articles and decorate my website at any time. The reference manual is excellent and detailed. Everything about Pelican can be found there!</p>
<h2 id="on-whom-the-blog-is-for">On Whom the Blog Is For</h2>
<p>    The blog is for people who love coding and who are interested in computer science and software engineering. That's a JOKE! I welcome everyone to visit my blog :-) If you don't like reading things about computers, just click here and click there --- who knows what surprise you will find.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-a-file-from-my-blog">How to Download a File from my Blog</h2>
<p>    There are roughly two kinds of files available to download in the blog: files that are small with internal links and files that are big with external links.<br/>
    Click <a href="/articles/Introducing My New Blog/download.txt" target="_blank">here</a> to download an example internal file. It's a small text file, and some browsers may directly open it for you.<br/>
    Click <a href="https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/" target="_blank">here</a> to open an external link. It's EICAR virus test files download page! You can download those files to test your antimalware! Haven't heard of computer virus for a long time? <strong>Be careful when downloading a file from the Internet</strong>, as the virus is less conspicuous and is not yet extinct.</p>
<h2 id="will-math-formulae-be-correctly-displayed">Will Math Formulae Be Correctly Displayed</h2>
<p>     Don't worry about this problem. If the javascripts are loaded and enabled, nothing will go wrong <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:<br/>

<h2 id="on-the-language">On the Language</h2>
<p>    English is not my native language. I use English because it's supported on almost all devices and the number of people who can read English is certainly larger than that of who can read Chinese, which is my first language. Therefore, people all over the world can read my articles without any help from online translators. Articles in my blog would mainly related to computer science, where English nouns are common, but I don't like adding too many English words in my Chinese articles. The mixture is disgusting to me. That's another reason I build this English blog. I would use simple English in my blog.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-priciples-of-my-blog">On the Priciples of My Blog</h2>
<p>    In my opinion, my blog should be clean and simple. There shouldn't be too much meaningless information on the website. So there will be <strong>NO AD</strong>, <strong>NO ANIMATION</strong> and <strong>NO NONSENSE</strong>. I also think that the speed of my blog is important. My blog is currently running on Github Pages, so fancy stuff can't be added to the wesite. Waiting more than 10 seconds for a thousand-word passage is intolerable.<br/>
    Some people may share their life in the blogs, while I do not. Nevertheless, I would share what I thought or I'm thinking with you, some of which would be regarded by somebody to be political. I hereby declare that I am PATRIOTIC and I have NO INTENTION TO OFFEND any governments, especially the one that provides me with opportunities to live and study, in peace and of high quality. If you think I'm a potential betrayer, I will say "WRONG!"</p>
